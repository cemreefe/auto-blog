In this article, we will explore the fascinating concept of gravity and how it varies on different planets.</p>

<h3>The Universal Law of Gravitation</h3>
<p>The universal law of gravitation, formulated by Sir Isaac Newton in the 17th century, provides a mathematical framework to explain gravity. According to this law, every particle of matter attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. This means that the larger the mass of an object and the closer it is to another object, the stronger the force of gravity.</p>(Read more)</div></a></div>
