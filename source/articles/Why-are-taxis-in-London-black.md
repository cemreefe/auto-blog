# The Fascinating History Behind London's Black Taxis

*By Marcus Applebee*

London is not only famous for its iconic landmarks and bustling streets but also for its distinct black taxis that roam the city. Have you ever wondered why taxis in London are predominantly black? Let's take a closer look at the history behind this unique tradition.

## The Origin of London's Black Taxis

The story dates back to the early 1900s when the Public Carriage Office (PCO) - later known as the Public Carriage Office and Metropolitan Police, set standards for the London taxi industry. As part of these regulations, a specific design was established to ensure that taxis were easily identifiable and met certain requirements for passenger safety and comfort.

## Choosy About the Color

The initial PCO regulations defined that taxicabs should be painted in a dark color, with black being favored due to its elegance and ease of maintenance. However, this requirement does not mandate all taxis to be black; it allows for other dark-colored vehicles to be used as taxis as well. Nevertheless, black became synonymous with London's iconic taxis.

## Practicality and Quality

Apart from aesthetics, there were practical reasons for favoring black vehicles. Black paint was readily available at the time and relatively cheap. Additionally, black is an excellent color to mask dirt and grime, keeping the taxis presentable and clean even after hours of use in a bustling city like London.

Another important factor was the durability and longevity of black paint. With London's unpredictable and sometimes harsh weather, it was vital to use paint that could withstand the elements, making black an ideal choice.

## Modern-Day Symbolism

Over the years, London's black taxis have become a symbol of the capital city's identity, an iconic feature that locals and tourists alike associate with the bustling streets of London. The sight of a black taxi weaving through traffic is instantly recognizable and an essential part of the city's charm.

## The London Taxi Company

To maintain this legacy, the London Taxi Company (LTC) was established many years ago to produce and regulate the iconic black cabs. Today, the company is known as the London Electric Vehicle Company (LEVC), and it continues to manufacture modern electric taxis that uphold the traditional design while incorporating sustainable technology.

## Conclusion

The distinctive black color of London's taxis has become an integral part of the city's identity. While initially black was chosen for its practicality and elegance, over the years, it has become synonymous with London's iconic transportation. The history and tradition behind these vehicles inspire a sense of nostalgia and pride for both locals and visitors alike. So, the next time you find yourself in London, keep an eye out for these timeless black cabs as you explore the city's vibrant streets.
