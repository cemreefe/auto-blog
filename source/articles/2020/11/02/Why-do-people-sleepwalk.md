# Why Do People Sleepwalk?

*By Marcus Applebee*



Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism, is a sleep disorder that affects approximately 1-15% of the population. It is characterized by episodes of walking or performing complex activities while still asleep. But what causes people to sleepwalk? Let's delve into the topic to understand the underlying factors.

## What is Sleepwalking?

Sleepwalking is a parasomnia, a category of sleep disorders that involve abnormal behaviors occurring during sleep. Common features of sleepwalking include walking around the room, talking, sitting up in bed, or even leaving the house. However, sleepwalkers typically have no recollection of their actions afterward.

## The Role of Genetics

One of the notable factors contributing to sleepwalking is genetics. Studies have shown that if a parent has a history of sleepwalking, the likelihood of their child also experiencing sleepwalking increases significantly. This suggests a strong genetic component to the disorder. Specific genes related to sleep regulation and brain development have been identified as potential contributors to sleepwalking tendencies.

## Developmental Factors

Sleepwalking is more common in children and tends to occur during deep non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep. The prevalence of sleepwalking decreases with age, with most cases resolving by adulthood. These developmental factors suggest that sleepwalking may be linked to the maturation of the nervous system.

## Sleep Deprivation and Fatigue

Lack of adequate sleep or chronic sleep deprivation can increase the likelihood of sleepwalking episodes. When individuals do not get enough restorative sleep, it can disrupt the normal sleep cycle, leading to various sleep disorders, including sleepwalking. Additionally, physical and mental exhaustion can contribute to the occurrence of sleepwalking events.

## Other Contributing Factors

Several other factors can increase the chances of sleepwalking:

1. **Sleep Disorders:** Certain sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome, can coexist with sleepwalking, suggesting a potential association between these conditions.
2. **Medications:** Some medications that affect the central nervous system, such as sedatives and certain antidepressants, may increase the risk of sleepwalking.
3. **Stress and Anxiety:** Emotional stress and anxiety can disrupt the normal sleep patterns and increase the likelihood of sleepwalking.
4. **Alcohol and Drug Use:** The consumption of alcohol or certain medications can increase the risk of sleepwalking episodes.

## Seeking Medical Evaluation and Treatment

While occasional sleepwalking episodes may not require medical intervention, persistent or disruptive sleepwalking should be evaluated by a healthcare professional. They can assess for any underlying sleep disorders or contributing factors and provide appropriate treatment options.

Treatment approaches for sleepwalking may include:

- **Improving Sleep Hygiene:** Establishing a regular sleep schedule, creating a conducive sleep environment, and practicing relaxation techniques to promote better sleep quality.
- **Treating Underlying Sleep Disorders:** Addressing any coexisting sleep disorders, such as sleep apnea, restless leg syndrome, or insomnia.
- **Medications:** In certain cases, medications such as benzodiazepines may be prescribed to reduce sleepwalking episodes.
- **Stress Management:** Employing stress management techniques, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy or counseling, can help alleviate anxiety-related sleepwalking episodes.

## Conclusion

Sleepwalking can be a fascinating yet concerning sleep disorder. While the exact cause is not fully understood, genetic factors, developmental aspects, sleep deprivation, and other contributing factors play a significant role. It is essential to seek medical attention if sleepwalking becomes frequent, disruptive, or poses a risk to the individual's safety. With proper evaluation and treatment, sleepwalkers can find relief and improve their sleep quality.
